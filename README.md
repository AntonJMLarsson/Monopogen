Single Cell Population Genetics and Association Analysis Toolkit

**scPopMap** is python package for population analysis in single-cell studies, developed and maintained by [Ken chen's lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kchenlab/Home) in MDACC. `scPopMap` is developed to benefit the population-level association study for single cell studies. It is composed of four modules:
